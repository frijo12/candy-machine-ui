**Candy Machine UI Setup Guide**

This comprehensive guide offers a step-by-step walkthrough to create the user interface (UI) for your Candy Machine, facilitating the minting of NFTs using the configured SPL token. The UI seamlessly integrates the SPL token as the chosen payment method, empowering users to connect their Phantom wallets effortlessly.

**Prerequisites**
Ensure the following prerequisites are met before proceeding:

1. A properly configured Candy Machine with specific details in its `config.json` file, including price, quantity, symbol, seller fee, SPL token account, SPL token, go-live date, and creator details.
2. A designated Phantom wallet intended for minting.

**Steps**

1. **SPL Token Setup:**
   If not already done, follow the guidelines from Lesson Three to create the SPL token. Document the SPL token's address.

2. **Update Candy Machine Config:**
   Open the `config.json` file of your Candy Machine and make the necessary adjustments:
   - `splTokenAccount`: Update with the address of the created SPL token account.
   - `splToken`: Update with the address of the SPL token.

3. **UI Setup:**
   Refer to the "Quick Node: Set Up a Minting Site" tutorial to create a user-friendly interface for your Candy Machine. This UI empowers users to connect their Phantom wallets and mint NFTs using the SPL token.

4. **Modify Minting Logic:**
   Adjust the minting logic of your SPL project (as per Lesson Three) to either mint NFTs to the Phantom wallet address or adapt the transfer function to dispatch minted NFTs to your Phantom wallet.

5. **Testing:**
   Thoroughly test the entire setup by transferring or minting your SPL token to one of your Phantom accounts. Utilize the created UI to mint NFTs, ensuring users can seamlessly mint NFTs by using the SPL token as the payment method.

**Additional Tips**

- For a more in-depth implementation of the Candy Machine logic, covering minting functionality and token configuration, refer to my Candy Machine Repository.
- The creation of the SPL token is based on the SPL token Program by MetaCrafters.
- Verify that addresses and token details in the `config.json` align with the addresses and tokens you've created.
- Ensure clear and concise instructions in your UI guide users on connecting their Phantom wallets and minting NFTs.
- Personalize your UI further according to your design preferences.

**Conclusion**

By diligently following these steps, you'll successfully establish a Candy Machine UI, enabling users to mint NFTs using the configured SPL token. Users can effortlessly connect their Phantom wallets and use the SPL token for payment to mint NFTs through your Candy Machine. Prioritize thorough testing before deploying the setup for public use.
